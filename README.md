## Building the project
To build the project, run `CMake` on the current directory with the desired
Generator.

Usually, on windows, CMake provides a GUI to configure the project using
Visual Studio, MinGW or even other compilers.

On FreeBSD, a Makefile to be used with bmake(1) is going to be generated.
On Linux, a GNUMakefile is going to be generated to be used with gmake(1).
